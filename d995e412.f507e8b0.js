These parties are called the %%participants of the transaction|participant%%. A typical %%business transaction|transaction%% consists of three phases. In the first phase, a %%transaction agreement|transaction-agreement%% is negotiated between the participants. That phase ends when either participant quits the negotiation, or all participants commit to the transaction, which basically is a promise to the other participants that it will keep up its end of the %%transaction agreement|transaction-agreement%%. In the second phase, the participants work to fulfill their promise. That phase ends when they deliver the results, and inform their peers of that they're done. In the final phase, participants check whether or not they have received what was promised, and that it conforms the criteria in the transaction agreement. This may lead to some discussion and possible rectifications. The final phase ends either when one of the participants escalates (e.g. goes to court), or all results are accepted.

Doing so implicitly specifies the kinds of data that the form will ask for. Secondly, the provider must decide for each of the data it receives, whether or not it is valid to be used in that argument - the process of deciding this is called 'validation'. Common criteria that help to make this distinction include whether or not the data is presented in the expected format, whether or not it is true (not so easy), whether it is not outdated, or whether or not it satisfies validation rules (in the example, the municipality may require that the specified license plate belongs to a car owned by the person that requests the permit).
